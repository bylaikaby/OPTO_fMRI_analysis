 SESCSCAN - Load and analyzed control scans<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;SESCSCAN (SesName, ScanType) loads all contol scans and selects<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;activated voxels. As control scans we define all those scans that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are collected in the beginning, middle or end of a session, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;check the quality of the signal. They do not require event (dgz)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;files, and are usually Epi13 or Time-Course (50,50,156 images)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;block design scans. The Epi13 typically has TR of 6s and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Time-Course TR of 0.250 seconds. If ScanType is defined only that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;type of scan is loaded and analyzed. If not, then the field<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ses.cscan is examined, and every subfields are subjected to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis.<br>
