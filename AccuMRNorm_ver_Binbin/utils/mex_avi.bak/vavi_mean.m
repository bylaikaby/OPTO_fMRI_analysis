%VAVI_MEAN -  Compute mean image from AVI frames.
%   IMGMEAN = VAVI_MEAN(AVIFILE,FRAMES)
%   [IMGMEAN IMGSTD WIDTH HEIGHT NFRAMES] = VAVI_READ(AVIFILE,FRAMES)
%   computes mean/std images of given FRAMES.
%
%   Note that FRAMES must be within 0 to 66050, and not Matlab
%   indexing (start from 1).
%   If a frame number in FRAMES is -1, it will be treated as a blank
%   (black) image.
%   If FRAMES is empty, VAVI_MEAN process across
%   all frames in the AVIFILE.
