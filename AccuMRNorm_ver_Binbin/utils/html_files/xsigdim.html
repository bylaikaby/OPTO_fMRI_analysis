 XSIGDIM - Creates a vector of size length(Dim) and appropriate units<br>
 	XSIGDIM(Sig, Dim) is used to convert the typical<br>
 	[0:size(Sig.dat,Dim)-1] vector into something meaningful, such as<br>
 	time, frequency etc. It does so by using the unit information included<br>
 	in the Sig structure, commonly Sig.dx(), where by each element is the<br>
 	sampling rate in the time or frequency domain.<br>
 	We use this often with spectrograms to extract the time/frequency<br>
 	bases for both computing and plotting.<br>
