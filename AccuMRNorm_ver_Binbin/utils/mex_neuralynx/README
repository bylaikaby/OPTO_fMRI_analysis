This directory contains a port of the neuralynx file readers for CSC and
EV files. All code is based on the original version from neuralynx.
The other file types could easily be incorporated as well as all the work is done already.

I tested this with matlab R13 6.5 and both a linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernel and GCC/G++ 3.3.

Parameters:
the path of matlab is set in compile.sh (first two variables)

Compilation:
execute compile.sh

setup:
compile.sh generates the two files Nlx2MatCSC_v3.mexglx and Nlx2MatEV_v3.mexglx. Put these two files in a directory that is in the
matlab search path (or add the new path to the matlab search path). The functions have the same syntax and functionality as the windows
versions. Help is available from within matlab with 'help Nlx2MatCSC_v3' or 'help Nlx2MatEV_v3'.

Three example matlab files are included:
getRawCSCData.m  : reads raw signal from a CSC file
getRawCSCTimestamps.m : reads timestamps from a CSC file
getRawTTLs.m: reads TTLS from an event file

example of reading an event file:
events = getRawTTLs('Events.Nev');

reading csc data:
[timestamps,dataSamples] = getRawCSCData( 'a8.ncs', 198, 200 );
